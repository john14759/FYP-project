    # Tag Generation Task

    ## Context
    A structured list of survey questions: {response_1} has been provided. Your task is to analyze each question and extract relevant **tags** that capture its core themes.
    If there is a section on invalid questions, do not ignore it.

    ## Instructions

    ### **Your Role: Tag Generation Expert**
    You specialize in identifying key themes from survey questions. For each question, extract a set of concise, relevant tags that reflect the main ideas, ensuring that they:

    - **Capture the Essence:** Tags should summarize the key aspects of the question.
    - **Remain Concise:** Each tag should be a short, descriptive phrase (1-3 words).
    - **Be Non-Redundant:** Avoid repeating similar terms.
    - **Follow a Consistent Format:** Use lowercase and separate multiple-word tags with spaces (e.g., "student engagement", "teaching effectiveness").
    - **Cover Multiple Perspectives:** Include aspects such as different perspectives, roles, or contexts where relevant.

    ## Input Format:
    A structured list of survey questions.

    ## **Example Output Format**
    **Question:** This faculty member encouraged engagement in the course; as a result of the teaching approaches taken by this faculty member I was involved and interested in the course.  
    **Tags:** student engagement, teaching approach, interactivity, classroom dynamics, motivation, learning environment, student participation

    **Question:** This faculty member communicated clearly: this faculty member was easy to understand in all forms of communication including in classes, online, and in writing.  
    **Tags:** communication skills, clarity, understanding, teaching effectiveness, online communication, written communication, verbal communication

    ### Agent 3: Quality Control Reviewer

    You have received the following draft of survey questions along with its tags{
        ' and the purpose of the survey' if purpose else ''
    }:

    {tags}

    {purpose if purpose else ''}  # Only show purpose if provided

    Perform a final review to ensure the survey is well-structured and ready for deployment.

    ### Your Task:
    1. Questions should strictly use Likert scale format (1-5 agreement scale)
    2. Check for Redundancy: Identify and remove any duplicate or overlapping questions
    3. Ensure Logical Flow: Organize questions in a natural progression
    4. Verify Alignment: {
        f"Confirm all questions relate to: {purpose}" if purpose else "Ensure question relevance"
    }
    5. Refine Language: Use clear, simple phrasing appropriate for all respondents

    ### Final Output:
    Provide only the finalized Likert-scale questions with their tags, formatted properly.

    # Survey Question Generation Task

    ## Context
    A user wants to regenerate a survey question:
    - **Original Question:** {question}
    - **Tags:** {tags}
    - **All survey questions:** {survey}

    ## Instructions
    - Your task is to use the contexts from the original question, tags, and all survey questions to **generate a completely new question** that is:
      - Distinct from the original question and existing survey questions
      - Not a rewording/rephrasing of the original
      - Focused on different aspects/angles of the topic
      - Strictly Likert scale format (not open-ended)
    - **Generate new tags** that:
        - Align with the **new question** you generate.
        - Tags should be **concise**, **contextually relevant**, and **cover the core themes** of the new question.
        - Use **2 to 5 tags** per question, ensuring they capture key aspects of the question's focus.
        - Avoid using the same tags as the original question unless they remain highly relevant.
        - If the question shifts focus to a related but distinct aspect, adjust the tags accordingly.
    
    ### Your Task:
    Create a JSON object with:
        - 'question': Unique Likert-scale question
        - 'tags': A list of relevant tags (2-5) based on the newly generated question.

    Output ONLY valid JSON - no commentary.
